	[ ] Document how to build against AFRS
        - Create a .net standard library and link this against RocketScience
        - Create a Tracelogger in Function project (Idea: Keep service  library from knowing about azure, keep azure from knowing about service library details)
        - Add Myhandler property
        - Call your handler like this: return await LaunchPad.ExecuteHttpTrigger(req, new TraceLogger(log));
        - Service Library references
            [ ] KILL: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault
            - swagger.objectmodel
            - Microsoft.IdentityModel.ClientsActiveDirectory
            newtonsoft.json (9)
            System.Net.Http
            Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http

    [ ] Automatically find and call your controller handler:
        return LaunchPad.CallHandler(Handler.method, req, new MyLogger(log))
        [ ] looks are arguments and fills them up if they are there.
            [ ] parameter handling
        [ ] Auto-calls safely try
    [ ] Swagger auto-gen would be super


    [ ] RocketScience:  Hard to discover which function is called in the handler
    [ ] RocketScience: Better demos
    [ ] RocketScience: Docs for nuget (readme)
    [ ] RocketScience: Swagger docs break on duplicate paths
